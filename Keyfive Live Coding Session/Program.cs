//Keyfive Coding Test

//Requirements

//Update the Telemetry.cs class file which should Implement 'ITelemetry'

//The Telemetry class (or record) should represent data collected from a device. Each telemetry object will have:
//       DeviceId: Identifier for the device.
//       Name: Name of the device.
//       Timestamp: The time when the telemetry data was recorded.
//Value: The value of the data collected(e.g., temperature).
//       Unit: The unit of the collected value(e.g., Celsius, Fahrenheit).
//The 'UpdateValue' method should update the Value and refresh the Timestamp to the current time.
//The 'Display()' method should print the telemetry data to the console.

//The Unit Tests in the TelemetryTests.cs file will need to run and pass before the live coding session
//Make sure you have restored the Xunit packages linked to the project.The following Nuget package will need to be restored / installed:
//       Microsoft.NET.Test.Sdk
//       xunit
//       xunit.runner.visualstudio
